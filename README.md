This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Jamie's vacation is about to end. She works at an international company, so she can choose another office to work from: either Amsterdam, Madrid, or Budapest.

Api's used:
- AccuWeatherAPI for weather forecasts (https://developer.accuweather.com)
- KiwiAPI for flight search (https://docs.kiwi.com)
